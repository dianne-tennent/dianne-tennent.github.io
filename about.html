          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Haere mai. Ko Dianne toku ingoa. Ko Lower Hutt toku kainga.</p>

            <p>I’m doing EDA because I think tech has a huge potential to support the learning needs of our young people and I want to be in a position where I can develop tools that support learning, particularly around literacy.</p>

            <p>The thing I value most is inclusion.</p> 
            <p>Inclusion in all areas such as race, culture, gender, sexuality, but also just general inclusion with regard to respecting and taking into account a range of points of view, with the goal being an outcome that meets everyone’s needs. Another important value for me is forgiveness - of ones self and of others. We’re all human and it’s so important to give ourselves and others a break and create a supportive environment within which we can all flourish.
