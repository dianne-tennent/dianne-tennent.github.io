      <h3>Identity and values exploration</h3>

          <section class="light">
          <p>I think my number one value is being able to see things from multiple perspectives. Everyone brings their own histories and experiences with them that inform the way they see the world, and I truly believe that no one perspective is more valuable than another. I believe harnessing a collective pool of wisdom and experience is the best way to arrive at an ideal solution. That being said, in my earlier years, I would often default to valuing other peoples’ points of view more highly than my own. So in recent years I have been learning how to listen to my own inner wisdom, and value this knowledge and experience just as much as I value that of others. It’s always a balancing act, and much more cognitively demanding, and I don’t always get it right. So it’s important to always be kind and accepting of myself and others. </p>

          <h5>Achievements</h5>

          <p>Some achievements I’m proud of are writing and recording an album of songs, and making it to the final of the Wellington Raw Comedy Quest. These two achievements were a result of my ability to harness my own creativity and use it to actually produce something worthwhile! I do love the creative process and I’m fascinated by its mercurial nature. I’ve learned over the years that when I’m too focused on the outcome of this process, it actually gets in the way. So I’ve learned to not be so hard on myself when I’m going through periods where I’m not being creative, because it’s something that I believe can’t actually be forced or willed into existence. That being said, there’s no use in just “waiting for the lightning to strike” - especially in a work scenario. So I try to do things that facilitate my creativity in a work context, such as meditation practice, journaling, and being open to new ways of doing things. I found that as a teacher there were so many opportunities to be creative so I was able to harness this energy at work in a lot of ways. However, there are always practical constraints that get in the way of implementing new innovations, so it’s important to be realistic about that.</p>

          <h5>Personality</h5>

          <p>I’m happy with the outcome of the Myers-Briggs test - the title “Mediator” really resonates with me, because I think my goal is often to get the best outcome for all parties involved. This is what made teaching quite difficult, because it was often unrealistic to meet the needs of every student in my class. This is why I like the idea of being a developer, because from what I understand, meeting the needs of a wide range of users is always a priority, and I hope I will have the luxury of time to be able to design and develop solutions that meet those needs. </p>

          <p>Questions about whether I let my emotions guide my decision making are interesting, because I’ve done a lot of work over the past few years learning to become more mindful of my emotions and developing self-compassion, in order to avoid letting myself be controlled by them. It’s been so great to develop this awareness and listen to what my emotions are telling me, but then to have the presence of mind to take a wise course of action, rather than a reactive one. It’s not always easy, particularly when you’re in a stressful work environment, but I’ve definitely become much better at it, and I’m committed to continuing this practice throughout my life.</p>

          <h5>“The boundary to what we can accept is the boundary to our freedom.”</h5>

          <p>This quote really resonates with me because to me it contains the key to moving forward regardless of any obstacles. I think often the times when we get stuck are the times when we are saying no to our experience, to ourselves and others,  and to the nature of reality. Saying no contracts our awareness and cuts us off from the world around us. The ability to say yes to life just as it is allows us to expand our awareness to include a myriad of possibilities that we would otherwise be blind to. It gives us access to resources that we wouldn’t otherwise have. Acceptance puts us in a position to respond with kindness to whatever situation we are faced with and take the wise, compassionate course of action. </p>

          <h5>This Week</h5>

          <p>I came across challenges this week that I didn’t expect to. It was very humbling and difficult to maintain the equanimity I aspire to! I was confronted with a weakness I knew I had, which was my reluctance to ask for help. There’s a certain pride I think I hold onto in being self-sufficient and not depending on others. But in reality, we all depend on each other in so many ways it’s impossible to avoid! This is definitely an area I need to continue to work on and remember that asking for help is not a sign of weakness or something to be ashamed of, it’s recognising the reality of our interconnectedness and part of what makes a community strong. </p>

          <h5>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h5>

          <p>An ethical decision I found difficult recently was when I was organising a group of staff to do a music performance. In the past, I had taken part in a group a few times with a very select group of people, and there was always some feeling of exclusivity that made me uneasy. I felt bad when other staff members seemed like they wanted to join in, but I had been reluctant to invite them because I was a relatively new staff member, and I was worried about compromising the quality of the performance by allowing less skilled musicians to take part. Last year I made the conscious decision to make an open invitation to all staff members to join a staff singing group. It meant that we were working with less experienced singers, and so it took a lot longer to get everyone up to an acceptable performance standard. But in the end I was really glad that I did it, because I think it gave less confident singers an opportunity to do something fun and learn and get involved, and also I hope it promoted a culture of inclusivity among the staff. It felt really good to put my values (inclusion) ahead of my own ego and ambition.</p>

          <h5>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>

          <p>I think being the descendant of a colonising people has given me a lot of privilege and advantage, and has probably made me blind to a lot of the struggles of non-dominant populations. I try really hard to remember this privilege and remember that not everyone has this, and to use my privilege to serve and support others who are less privileged. Being of the dominant culture, it can feel a little bit like you don’t have a culture, because by its very nature it assumes it’s the norm. So I try really hard to remember that other cultures are not inferior or unusual, they are completely valid alternatives for living and there is a lot I can learn as a Pakeha from other cultures within the New Zealand context. </p>
