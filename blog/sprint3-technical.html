      <h3>The DOM</h3>

          <h4>What’s the difference between HTML and CSS?</h4>
          <p>HTML is like a set of boxes. Each box has some content inside and each box has a label on the outside, so that we know what’s inside each box. </p>

          <p>CSS is like a kid who makes a fort out of the boxes. They might line them all up or paint them different colors and arrange them in different ways. They might decide to put all the heavy boxes to one side and only arrange the lighter ones.</p>

          <h4>What is control flow? What are loops?</h4>

          <p>Control flow basically refers to the order in which you do things. When you get dressed, it’s important that you put your underwear on, before you put on the rest of your clothes. If you get the order wrong, then you’d end up wearing your underwear over top of your pants, and that would look pretty weird. It’s the same with programming - you have to be aware of how the order of your statements is affecting the way the program runs and therefore the final outcome.</p>

          <p>Loops! With a loop, you’re basically repeating a set of instructions multiple times until a given condition is reached. A useful example might be hanging out the washing. The basic actions are 1: picking up the item, and 2: attaching it to the line with pegs. Those two actions will be repeated until the laundry basket is empty. So the condition that controls the loop is whether the basket is empty or not. Some pseudo code for this might be:</p>

          <h4>What is the DOM? How do you interact with it?</h4>

          <p>The DOM is the representation of everything that is being displayed on a webpage. We use the DOM to interact with the webpage in a variety of ways. You can make temporary changes to content and style on the page by updating code within the DevTools window. For example, you could change the color of the background. The DOM also allows you to target specific elements and manipulate them by applying programming functions to them.</p>

          <h4>What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h4>

          <p>When you access data from an array, you are basically selecting an item number from a list and displaying that item. This is notated with square brackets and a number in between e.g. listName[2] will show you the third item in that list. </p>

          <p>When you access data from an object, you can either display the whole object and all its corresponding properties, or you can specify which property of the object you want to display. For example, you might have an object called myCat, which has 3 properties: name, age and breed, and 3 corresponding values: Bernie, 4, tabby. If I wanted to display my cat’s name, I’d could write myCat.name and this would display the value “Bernie” </p>

          <h4>What are functions and why are they useful?</h4>
          <p>Functions are basically sets of instructions that are written to create a certain outcome. We put these instructions into their own box, called a function, with a label, and whenever we want that particular outcome, we can call that function by typing the label. </p>

          <p>An example of a function is one that can tell you which zodiac sign you are based on your birth date. That function would have parameters that would allow you to input any date, and the set of instructions inside the function would perform calculations on those numbers, and the output of the function would be whatever zodiac animal you happened to be. </p>

          <p>So functions are handy, because we can group things into meaningful chunks which allow us perform a variety of larger, more complex operations.</p>
