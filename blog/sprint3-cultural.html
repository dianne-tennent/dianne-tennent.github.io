      <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <p class="center">15-Feb-2021</p>

          <section class="light">
            <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognise, understand, interpret and respond appropriately to the emotional experiences of ourselves and others. It’s a skill that reflects one’s ability to manage the complex and nuanced emotional world of human beings.  </p>

          <p>We’re not born with EQ, it’s something learned throughout our life, mostly through our relationship with our primary caregiver as children. Those lucky enough to have a parent with a high EQ have probably developed a high level of emotional intelligence and can easily identify the emotional experiences of themselves and others, and respond with empathy and compassion. Thankfully, those whose parents were low on the EQ scale are still able to learn these skills, but it can take a little longer. </p>

          <p>There is quite often a direct relationship between the ability to recognise one’s own emotional experiences, and the ability to recognise those of others. Meditative practices emerging from Buddhist traditions are designed to develop this first capacity, with the intended outcome being the second.</p>

          <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>

          <p>Given our definition above, IQ could be described as “the ability to recognise, understand, interpret and respond appropriately to information.” IQ relates to ideas and concepts, logic and reason, information divorced from its impact on the social and emotional well-being of humanity. This is not to say that IQ is inherently amoral or devoid of social good, but that it is not in itself sufficient to attend to and solve many of the human problems we face in our world today.</p>

          <h5>Why is it important?</h5>

          <p>A fundamental principle underlying most Buddhist traditions is <a href="http://chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php/The_Two_Pillars_of_Buddhism%E2%80%94_Consciousness_and_Ethics_by_Pier_Luigi_Luisi">“The Two Pillars: Wisdom and Compassion.”</a> To me, IQ and EQ are modern representations of these two pillars. The idea is that both pillars are equally important, and when one falters, the other is of little value. </p>

            <figcaption>A painting called Rigsum Gonpo – it’s a traditional work of a subject matter popular in Tibet – the three figures are considered the three primary protectors, or the three qualities that Buddhist practitioners require in order to attain enlightenment. They are: the Buddha of Compassion, in white, and the one to his right with the sword is Manjushri, the Buddha of Wisdom. The third on his [the Buddha of Compassion's] left with the blue fierce-looking face is Vajrapani, the deity of strength of mind, or Concentration. This work was commissioned by the <a href="https://www.aaa-a.org/programs/conversation-with-ang-tsherin-sherpa/">Asian Art Museum</a> in San Francisco for their Himalayan collection.</figcaption>

          <p>To my surprise, this was depicted extremely well in the character of one of cinema’s most famous villains: Mr Hans Gruber from the movie Die Hard. Gruber and his associates enter the Nakatome Plaza with total precision and a chilling level of calmness. Gruber’s superior intellect is displayed through the various mindgames he plays with his victims in order to access the highly secured inner vault. He kills them quickly and calmly, devoid of any emotion. To me, he can be viewed as an illustration of a really high IQ, or level of wisdom, with a complete lack of EQ, i.e. compassion.  </p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama uses the example of a nuclear physicist who can either blow up the world with a nuclear bomb, or use their knowledge to develop environmentally friendly forms of energy to benefit humankind and the planet. It all depends on an equal balance between the strength of the intellect and the strength of our compassion towards each other. </p>
