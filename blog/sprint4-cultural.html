      <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p class="center">22-Feb-2021</p>

            <h4>Plastic, growing brains.</h4>

          <p class='center'>It’s an incredibly simple concept: your brain can change.</p>

          <p>It’s very easy to see neuroplasticity in action when you think about how we can learn a musical instrument, or a second language. We begin knowing only a few chords or words, then after an extended period of time and practice, we can hold a conversation, or play a beautiful piece of music.  </p>

          <p>The pervasive myth, however, is that as we get older, we lose this capability. But research now shows that, while our ability to form new neural networks does reduce as we age, it never disappears completely.</p>

          <h5>Great news! You can learn anything, at any age. But so what?</h5>

          <p>The key is in harnessing this knowledge to actually improve your ability to learn. The other thing that research shows, is that understanding how the learning process works, actually aids the learning process.</p>

          <p>You may have heard the recently coined adage: “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” Combine this with spaced repetition, and you’ve got an unstoppable formula for success. The moral of the story is: try. Try again. Try again. And science tells you, that if you just repeat this process over and over, it’s virtually impossible NOT to learn something. </p>

          <p>The beautiful thing about this is that it gives us hope. When we find something to be seemingly insurmountable, all we need to remember is that science says, definitively, that it is possible. Never mind all the old worn out sayings like “never give up” or “believe you can succeed” — this is not a matter of faith or belief. This is FACT. </p>

          <h5>You CAN do this. </h5>

          <h5>Q+A</h5>
          <h4>How can understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit me?</h4>
          <p>Research shows that when people understand and believe that their brain can easily form new neural networks with practice, this actually motivates them to learn and improves their ability to learn. When things seem too difficult, you can remind yourself that anyone can learn anything: it just takes time and practice.</p>
          <h4>What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity?</h4>
          <p>You can increase the frequency of practice, making it regular, daily. You can also link new concepts to things you already know, i.e. existing neural networks. <a href="https://centerhealthyminds.org/feature/neuroplasticity#">Here's a useful resource about neuroplasticity.</a></p>

          <h5>Growth Mindset</h5>
          <p>Growth mindset is about our implicit beliefs about the capability of ourselves and others to actually grow and change. It is relevant because if we don’t have a growth mindset, it reduces our ability to learn, grow and change.</p>

          <p>The most interesting thing I learned was actually more relevant to Emotional Intelligence, but there is significant overlap. The idea was that EQ is learned, not innate. I realised that I had been believing that people were either naturally kind or not. So this gave me hope that I can actually genuinely establish a good moral compass within myself, even if it doesn’t come naturally. And that I’m not a “bad person” if I don’t have amazing EQ, I just haven’t learned it yet. </p>

          <h4>How can you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>
          <p>You can allow yourself to make mistakes. Remember that if you can’t do something it doesn’t mean you're not good enough or incapable, it just means you're not there quite yet, but you will be soon. <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Here's some more info on Growth vs Fixed Mindsets</a></p>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>I realised that comparing myself with others was a fixed-mindset characteristic. So I will remember that and take it as an opportunity for learning, rather than a judgement.</p>
          <p>I think I also need to imagine myself as a developer and actually believe that it’s possible. At the moment, whenever I’m not working on EDA I feel like I’m silly for even thinking that I can start a new career this way. But that is just a belief. So I’ll make sure I’m mindful of this fixed belief and imagine success rather than failure. </p>
