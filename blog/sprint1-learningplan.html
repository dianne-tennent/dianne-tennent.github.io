    <main><h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
      <p class="center">10-Feb-2021</p>

          <section class="light">
          <h4>Long term goal and/or career pathway</h4>
          <p>Long term I would like to work as a software developer for educational software. I would like to be able to use digital tools to meet a range of learning needs, particularly in the area of literacy.</p>

          <h4>Human skills I’d like to develop while at EDA</h4>
          <p>I would really like to develop a strong worth ethic and good habits when it comes to managing time and productivity. I’d like to get further experience working harmoniously and productively within a team environment. I’d also like to develop my “big picture” thinking, rather than getting lost in too many details. </p>

          <h4>My strengths and limitations</h4>
          <p>I’m a very detail oriented person, good at problem solving with a passion for creativity. On the flipside of this, I can sometimes spend too much time on perfecting and refining things, and considering a variety of potential approaches. This can be perfectionistic at times and get in the way of producing a satisfactory outcome, and “not seeing the wood for the trees.”</p>

          <h4>How I will manage my workload and work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h4>
          <p>Create a clear and detailed plan of what needs to be completed and by when. Trello could be a useful tool for this. I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Being professional and courteous at all times</li>
            <li>Communicating respectfully with others</li>
            <li>Communicating clearly and in a timely manner regarding meetings and work deadlines</li>
            <li>Sharing my knowledge with others</li>
            <li>Being supportive of other learners</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h4>
          <p>I will seek help by contacting my facilitator or other learners. I will do this in advance of project due dates and not at the last minute. </p>

          <h4>What I expect from the facilitation team</h4>
          <p>I would like the facilitation team to check in with me about my progress and give me feedback on the work that I’ve completed. </p>

          <h4>Scheduling information</h4>
          <p>I don’t have any other commitments, but it is important that I schedule in time for my own well-being and quality time with my partner, friends and family. </p>
