    <h3>Learning Plan 2.0</h3>
    <p>5-March-2021</p>
    <section class="dark">

      <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

      <p>My goal is to be involved in the design and development of software that supports education, particularly around literacy.</p> 

      <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>

      <p>Initially I identified my strength as being detail oriented, with the limitation of not seeing the wood for the trees. I’ve now also got some feedback from my partner who has pointed out that I am good at multi-tasking, but that I’m not great at delegating or asking for help. This is definitely familiar to me. I recognise that my need to come across as competent can get in the way of asking for help and getting support when I may need it or benefit from it. I think during Bootcamp I will need to make sure I ask for help where I need it so that I don’t get too stressed out and overwhelmed.</p>

      <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>

      <p>I think possibly my competitiveness will be the biggest challenge for me, because I will be constantly comparing myself to others and may let that either inflate my ego or make me feel inadequate. I need to be mindful that my own learning is my own journey and to celebrate others’ success and support those who need help.</p>

      <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>

      <p>I would actually like to develop leadership skills at Bootcamp. I can feel quite insecure when I’m in a position of leadership. So I’d like to develop the confidence to be in that role in a way that can motivate those I’m leading and create a fun and comfortable atmosphere. </p>

      <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>

      <p>I would like the Bootcamp team to check in with me from time to time to see how things are going. I’d like all the tasks and material to be clearly communicated.</p>

      <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Be in bed by 10</li>
        <li>Bring my lunch every day</li>
        <li>Exercise regularly</li>
        <li>Meditate regularly</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Write down questions I have or things I’m not sure of so that I can follow these up with a facilitator, either through Slack or in person.
        It’s important that I get good sleep, eat healthy food, exercise and meditate regularly to look after myself so that I am able to give my very best to this Bootcamp. The better I look after myself, the better I’ll be able to look after other people in the team and the more I will get out of the experience. I’ll need to be reliable and punctual, communicate clearly and regularly, and be accountable to those I’m working with.
