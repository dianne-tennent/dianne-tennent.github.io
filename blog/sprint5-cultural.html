      <h3>Overview - Foundations Core Skills</h3>
      <p class="center">5-March-2021</p>

          <section class="light">
            <h4>So what?</h4>

          <p>What surprised me the most about learning core is how essential these skills are. It was great to see Dev Academy really prioritise this kind of learning. It’s easy to see how even if you have the most highly technically skilled person, if they aren’t able to communicate well or work well in a team, then it’s difficult for them to add value to a team environment. I loved the pragmatic approach that Dev Academy takes, making it a learning opportunity rather than a fixed ability that you either have or you don’t. It gives me hope and confidence that I will be able to work productively as a member of a tech team and bring value to that space.   </p>

          <h3>
            
              What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h3>
              <ol>
              <li>I have a tendency to compare myself to others and feel disheartened when I’m not “as good” as them.</li>
              <li>I fluctuate between feeling totally on top of everything to totally hopeless.</li>
              <li>That the Pomodoro method and time tracking works really well to keep me focussed.</li>
            </ol>
              </p>
          
              <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

<p>Being mindful of one’s own values is really important because ideally we are working in a way that aligns with these values. This can provide a type of moral compass to use as a guide for decision making in a variety of circumstances. It also paves the way for engaging authentically with teams and projects and allows people to understand who you are and where you’re coming from, allowing you to connect meaningfully with like-minded people to work on projects which contribute something valuable to the world. </p>

<p>Empathy is the ability to understand someone else’s experience. There are three different types of empathy: affective, somatic and cognitive. All three are important as they help us to respond appropriately to the needs and experiences of others. When working in a team, it’s always important to be mindful of how others are feeling and experiencing situations, so that you can avoid causing undue stress to others. Conversely, it’s useful to communicate how you’re feeling and what you need so that others can more easily understand how to support you.</p>

<p>This leads nicely into self-awareness. Developing the habit of being mindful of your own thoughts and emotions is hugely important. We can very easily get caught in stories in our minds that are not always reflective of reality. The key is to be aware of these thoughts as just what they are - thoughts. This can prevent us from being adversely affected by any negative beliefs we might hold about ourselves or others. This can help ourselves and others to reach their full potential. We can also move our awareness to the sensations in our body which gives us information about our emotions that might be related to those thoughts. In this way we can develop a mindful compassion towards ourselves, which will help us to take appropriate action to look after our own well being and communicate our needs to others.</p>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

<p>I guess the most challenging thing was noticing the areas where I could develop further. Personal growth is a life-long project and takes a huge amount of commitment over an extended period of time. It is something that I have always been interested in, from my degree in Psychology, to my study of Buddhism and a range of self-help literature. So I am motivated to continue this journey, but realistic about the rate of progress that is possible.</p>

<h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

<p>I think that with programming it’s quite easy to get absorbed in the technicalities of the code and easy to lose sight of the human beings that are involved in creating it. Being mindful of the human side of tech allows us to work safely and productively together to create software that can actually enhance and improve peoples’ lives.</p>

<h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

<p>I think it’s a really important thing and not a waste of time. The more I learned about it, the more I understood how relevant it was. It also aligns really closely with my values and my motivation to build these skills in myself, as I can really see the value not only in the workplace, but also in my interactions and relationships with family and friends.</p>
